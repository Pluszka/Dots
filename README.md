# Dots
This code paints simple dots image inspired by Damien Hist artworks.
It's project from 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 by Angela Yu (day 18th)
I created it using turtle module. (Commented out part of code generated palette of colors based on one of Hist's artwork)
